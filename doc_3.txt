If body is specified, the specified data is sent after the headers are finished. It may be a str, a bytes-like object, an open file object, or an iterable of bytes. If body is a string, it is encoded as ISO-8859-1, the default for HTTP. If it is a bytes-like object, the bytes are sent as is. If it is a file object, the contents of the file is sent; this file object should support at least the read() method. If the file object is an instance of io.TextIOBase, the data returned by the read() method will be encoded as ISO-8859-1, otherwise the data returned by read() is sent as is. If body is an iterable, the elements of the iterable are sent as is until the iterable is exhausted.
